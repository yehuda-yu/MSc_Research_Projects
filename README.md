# MSc_Research_Projects


## Introduction
This repository summarizes all the data analysis and data from the various projects during my M.Sc degree in the Modeling and Monitoring Vegetation Systems lab at the Faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University.

## Files
* 1_Daily_Trend
Contains data on leaf samples collected to evaluate the daily trend of CO2 assimilation and transpiration of various species in a vertical green vegetation wall inside a laboratory space.

* 2_A_Ca_Curves_Analysis
Contains data and analysis of CO2 response curve in order to asses how changes in CO2 levels in the room affect on the CO2 assimilation rate of the plants.

* 3_Light_Response_Analysis
Contains data and analysis of light response curve in order to asses how changes in light intensity affect on the CO2 assimilation rate of the plants.

* 4_CO2_Analysis
Contains data and analysis of different CO2 inside and outside in order to quantify the GW effect on the CO2 levels inside the room. Includes time series data analysis and statistics.

* 5_Temperature_RH_Analysis
contains data and data analysis from temperature and humidity sensors to evaluate the spatial and temporal impact of a green wall on thermal comfort conditions in a room.

* Hyperspectral_Thermal_Analysis
This file includes hyperspectral & thermal data, and leaf samples to develop AI model and image processing for predicting green wall's environmental impact, detecting anomaly, and mapping species.
