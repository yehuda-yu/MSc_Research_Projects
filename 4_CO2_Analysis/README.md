## $CO_2$ Analysis

In this section I attach the data collected by the various sensors in the laboratory and outside it.
In addition, attached a code notebook in which I performed an in-depth analysis of the data in order to understand how the presence of vegetation in the room affects the on the CO2 levels.
The analysis includes the time series analysis of the data outside the laboratory and inside the laboratory in several different experiments
